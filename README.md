### Current progress
- Implemented the Marching Cubes algorithm using Compute Shaders (all calculations are performed on the graphics card)
- Ground layer (Next step: separate layers for ores and minerals)
- Simple cave generation algorithm using combinations of simplex noises (Next step: perlin worm)
